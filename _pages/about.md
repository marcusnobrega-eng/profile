Welcome to my GitHub page.

Hi, I am Marcus N. Gomes Jr, a 29-year-old born and raised in Brazil who likes barbecuing, watching soccer games, and loves seeing how water moves differently depending on the circumstances.

Bruce Lee once said: 

"<i>If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend</i>". 

This has always been on my mind. The water movement shapes the way how life works somehow.

Studying how water can change its shape, force, velocity, and physical properties, and how it can rapidly or sometimes take years to move under a specific media, is just one of the few amazing phenomena I am interested in understanding and learning from.

I am one of the guys who keep seeing the waves form in a lake when we throw a rock in the middle and keep thinking about how beautiful that is and how I could model that :)

I would resume myself as a simple kid passionate about water resources, trying to learn something new every day about this amazing field.

My formal education includes a background in <i>Civil and Environmental Engineering, Hydrology and Atmospheric Sciences, and Hydraulic Engineering and Sanitation</i>.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Arizona - Hydrology and Atmospheric Sciences studying hillslope hydrology merged with data assimilation techniques applied to one of the world's most extensive field experiments in hillslope hydrology - [The Landscape Evolution Observatory Hillslope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTN89IriGCI&t=21s&ab_channel=Biosphere2).

I hold a bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering (2013-2018), a Master's degree (2018-2020) and Ph.D. (2020-2023) in Hydraulics and Sanitation Engineering at the University of Sao Paulo.

In addition, I also have another ongoing Ph.D., which I started in 2020, in Civil and Environmental Engineering from the University of Texas at San Antonio, from which I still have one last credit to graduate, with plans to graduate in 2024.

Research
======
My research focuses on understanding and predicting components of the water cycle in relevant spatiotemporal scales using physics-based numerical modeling and data assimilation techniques via multi-source information. 

More specifically, my research goal is to develop state-of-the-art efficient tools to accurately represent flood and water quality transport and fate dynamics, especially in high spatiotemporal resolution, although not limited to.

In addition to this primary focus, I also have interest in:

- Hydrologic Modeling
- Hydrodynamic Modeling
- GPU Processing
- Green Infrastructure
- Low Impact Development
- Sustainable Drainage Systems
- Land surface Modeling
- Natural Hazards
- Early Warnings Systems
- Disaster Risk Reduction
- Serious Games
- Education in Science
