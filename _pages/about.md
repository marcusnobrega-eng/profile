Hi, and welcome to my page.

I am Marcus N. Gomes Jr., a passionate water resources engineer with a background in Civil and Environmental Engineering, Hydrology, Hydraulics and Sanitation Engineering.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Arizona - Hydrology and Atmospheric Sciences studying hillslope hydrology merged with data assimilation techniques applied to one of the world's most extensive field experiments in hillslope hydrology - [The Landscape Evolution Observatory Hillslope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTN89IriGCI&t=21s&ab_channel=Biosphere2).



My undergrad is in Civil Engineering (2013-2017), with my Masters and Ph.D. in Hydraulics and Sanitation Engineering at the University of Sao Paulo.

I also have another ongoing Ph.D. in Civil and Environmental Engineering from the University of Texas at San Antonio, from which I still have one last credit to graduate and plan to graduate in 2024.

Research
======
My research focuses on understanding and predicting components of the water cycle in relevant spatiotemporal scales using numerical modeling and data assimilation via multi-source information. 

More specifically, my research goal is to develop state-of-the-art efficient code to represent flood and water quality transport and fate dynamics, especially in high spatiotemporal resolution, although not limited to.

In addition to this primary focus, I also have interest in:

- Hydrologic Modeling
- Hydrodynamic Modeling
- GPU Processing
- Land surface Modeling
- Natural Hazards
- Early Warnings Systems
- Disaster Risk Reduction
- Serious Games
- Education in Science
