Dr. Peter Troch invited me to teach a class for the new master's program of UofA about fluid dynamics, in particular about the derivation of Bernoulli's equation from fundamental laws of energy and momentum conservation.
I personally enjoyed the lecture and received valuable feedback from the students. Slides of my part are available [Here](files/Week 3 Fluid Statics and Dynamics_MNGJr_edited.pptx).
