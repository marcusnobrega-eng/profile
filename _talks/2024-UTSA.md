I was invited by Dr. Giacomoni to give a class on the topic of 1D hydrodynamic simulations. I showcased the full derivation of the governing equations and presented several example applications of HydroHP-1D to solve engineering problems such as optimizing channel design, evaluating flood propagation in channels, and assessing the effects of dam breaks.
The slides and classes are available in the repository of [HydroHP-1D](https://github.com/marcusnobrega-eng/HydroHP).
