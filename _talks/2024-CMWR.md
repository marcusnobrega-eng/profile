At CMWR, I had a poster and an oral presentation.

- Identifying the state dependence of effective material properties in a simplified hydrologic hillslope model
In this poster presentation, we showed a calibrated hillslope 1D Richards, 2D Boussinesq model to simulate subsurface hydrological processes in LEO compared to a data assimilation technique.

- Large Scale Fully-Distributed Hydrologic-Hydrodynamic Modeling: Developing an Early-Warning Tool
In this presentation, we show the current advances we have in the development of an open-source, freely available early-warning tool for large-scale hydrology we are developing.
