A 3-day course of [HydroPol2D](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09325) fully distributed hydrologic-hydrodynamic modeling. In this course we:
- Delineated catchments and obtained all rasters and GIS files to run HydroPol2D
- Explained details and particularities of the model
- Showed the open-source code and explained how to adapt the model to the user needs
- Illustrated the input data procedure
- Applied the model for different types of rain-on-the-grid boundary conditions
