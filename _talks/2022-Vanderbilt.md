I was invited by Dr. Taha to present two classes for the Vanderbilt Civil Engineering undergraduate course to talk about the RTC-Stormwater model, a real-time control model of catchments, reservoirs, and channels.
 We derived the models and showcased some applications for estimating hydrological and hydrodynamic processes.
