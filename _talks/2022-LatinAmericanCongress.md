I presented two conference papers about applications of HydroHP-1D for varied cases, such as modeling of backwater effects, design of channels, complex boundary conditions, and dam-break scenarios. One of the papers was elected the best one in its category.
- A Serious Game for societal risk perception of dam-break flood assessment using a hydrodynamic model
- Assessing the role of cross-section shape for flood routing under compound flood events using a hydrodynamic model
