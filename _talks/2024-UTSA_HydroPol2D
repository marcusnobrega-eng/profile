A HydroPol2D course was given on Tuesday and Thursday in Dr. Giacomoni's class at UTSA. I showcased the derivation of HydroPol2D, including governing equations, model applications, the automation of GIS processing with Google Earth Engine, and the application of HydroPol2D for flood inundation mapping. 
Recorded classes, including slides (100+) available in the HydroPol2D [GitHub repositry](https://github.com/marcusnobrega-eng/HydroPol2D).
