excerpt: 'In this paper, we show that there exists a critical rainfall duration different from the time of concentration for small catchments with dissimilar land use. A common misconception is that assuming the rainfall duration as the time of concentration would result in a maximized urban hydrograph peak. We show that this is not the case and provide a simple solution for the problem that is easily programmable in Excel.'
