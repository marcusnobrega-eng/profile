title: "Exploring the impact of rainfall temporal distribution and critical durations on flood hazard modeling"
collection: publications

permalink: publication/2025-Exploring
excerpt: 'We evaluate the impact of different methods of predicting rainfall temporal variability and its impacts on flood hazard assessment. Using a 2D hydrologic-hydrodynamic model (HydroPol2D), we specifically evaluate the impact of typical synthetic rainfall distributions compared to the pattern of rainfall distribution derived from high-resolution rainfall data.'
