title: "Towards urban resilience through sustainable drainage systems: A multi-objective optimisation problem"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: publication/2020-Mineirinho
excerpt: 'We introduce a multi-objective optimization problem to place low-impact development techniques in a peri-urban catchment using hydrologic-hydrodynamic modeling with SWMM. Resilience metrics are defined as evaluating runoff reduction, water quality enhancement, and the positive effects that green infrastructure can have on society's well-being.'
