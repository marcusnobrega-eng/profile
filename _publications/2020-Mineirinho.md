excerpt: 'We introduce a multi-objective optimization problem to place low-impact development techniques in a peri-urban catchment using hydrologic-hydrodynamic modeling with SWMM. Resilience metrics are defined as evaluating runoff reduction, water quality enhancement, and the positive effects that green infrastructure can have on society's well-being'
